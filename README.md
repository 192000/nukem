# Nuke'm Legacy
**NOTICE: AS OF NOVEMBER 28TH, 2019 NUKE'M WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE ANY FURTHER UPDATES. BUT, THIS PROJECT WILL REMAIN ON THE GOOGLE CHROME WEB STORE UNTIL A CERTAIN BREAK POINT IS REACHED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.**

Nuke'm is a google chrome extension built to manage your browsing data fast & efficiently. Note: "Nuke/Nuked" means delete/deleted in the sense of this project.


Nuke'm offers many flexible features which are contained in its options menu. The program itself basically relies on user input, so it is highly recommended to configure this program on your first install.

**User friendly?**
 The most notable feature this program utilizes is that Nuke'm will do exactly what *you* want it to do, *and* when to do it, *never* what *it* wants to do and when *it* wants to do it. Thus said, Nuke'm will never operate by itself as a background process unless you want it to, using the *Auto-nuke* settings. 

**How do I use it?**
Another notable feature, Nuke'm will only execute when it's icon is clicked in the upper right. To add on to that, Nuke'm can also *exclusively* nuke *enabled* browsing data that associates with the URL of your *current open tab*. In other words, when Nuke'm is clicked, it will nuke selected browsing data from only the website in which you are currently browsing. 

**How do I know if it even works?**
For those who want to re-assure the programs working capability, Nuke'm also supports desktop notifications through the google chrome browser. If that's not enough, this project is open-source, so feel free to look under the hood.
